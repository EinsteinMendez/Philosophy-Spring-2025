1. Why was Socrates sentenced to death? Be sure to provide context and details and history background to give a fuller explanation. Answer : Socrates was sentenced to death in 399 BC by the Athenian court for corrupting the youth and impiety. He questioned traditional gods. His method of public questioning embarrassed powerful leaders. 

1. Why is there a conflict (for some) between science and religion? Dive deep into the very definitional debate that was illustrated in the film Mysterium Tremendum, both parts.Answer: In part 1 the sense of awe and mystery is examined and part 2 Science and Religion offer competing understandings by way of truth and evidence. Observation versus spiritual truth. Religion relies on God, while Science relies on testable hypotheses. 
2. Why are understanding physics and the general rules of the universe so important in doing philosophy? Answer: Understanding physics and the rules of the universe is important in philosophy because it helps us ask deeper questions about reality and how everything works and our thinking in how the world actually operates. 
3. List all of your extra credit here. Provide the chosen work and your essay. You can do more than one that was listed. Answer: Physicist Brian Greene explains that repulsive gravity may have caused the universe to rapidly expand after the Big Bang what science calls cosmic inflation. I personally believe this reflects God’s higher thinking, far beyond human understanding, setting everything into motion with perfect intention and design. What do you believe Dr. Lane ? 05/12/25
Hello Professor Lane,

I seen an interview with Brian Greene PhD and it was very interesting. The points below are what I thought was interesting : 

Missing energy suggests other universes from proton collider when they crash. Interesting. 

Repulsive Gravity caused rapid swelling in big bang . 
I think it was God with his higher thinking . 

String theory versus loop quantum gravity. 
If more people worked on LQG it would help because too many people are working on string theory . Interesting. 

Is there another universe where Sara Palin is President but it has to be compatible with the laws of physics. lol . 

Son shoe size analogy , if we find a parameter where a universe fits . Interesting. 

Time travel explanation coming back to quantum copy universe suggests origins won’t be affected . Interesting . 

Doppelgänger of our universe is an incorrect term but instead they are really mathematical distinctions of the same realty. Interesting. 

Can you please give me information on the AI program you have I’m interested.

4.How much of the required reading have you done? Just be transparent, no penalty for honesty.
6 How many of the required films did you watch? Again, be transparent since there is no penalty for honesty. Answer: I seen roughly 90% and I was astonished by them because there is so much knowledge in each. The good thing is that I will continue to see them and explore the NeuralSurfer even after the semester is over. 
7. What is the main argument of “being unknowing”? Give specific details concerning the reading and why it relates to Socrates and his own philosophical inquiry. Also relate the same to your own life and how it can radically change how you interact with others. Answer: “Being Unknowing” is that true wisdom begins with acknowledging one’s own ignorance. In my case I humbly ask God for Wisdom everyday so that I can deal with all the problems I have in life and it gets overwhelming but I hang in there admitting to God that I’m Unknowing and need his help. 
8. Why is probability elemental to understanding why certain events transpire? Use examples from the book Just Odds. Also provide some examples from your own life. Answer: In philosophy, probability is essential because it allows us to make sense of uncertainty, randomness, and the patterns underlying everyday events. 
9. Knowledge requires more than perception, it requires rational analysis of odds. For instance, the book Odds discusses how rolling a fair dice yields a 1-in-6 chance of landing on any number. But if the dice is weighted or the table is slanted, those odds change revealing that probability is not just about numbers, but about conditions and fairness. This philosophical point teaches us that behind every chance event lies a deeper structure we can analyze to predict, question, or even challenge. However, despite understanding the value of probability, I personally don’t rely on prediction as a guiding force in my life. Instead, I’ve adapted to a way of thinking that is rooted in faith, faith in purpose, timing, and meaning beyond what statistics can explain. While others may find comfort in calculating outcomes, I find peace in trusting that things unfold as they are meant to. This perspective doesn’t reject reason, but it recognizes that not everything can be measured. Some truths are felt, not calculated, and that’s where my convictions lie.
10. Give an updated version (in your own words, be creative) of Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. Imagine a group of siblings who have been raised since birth in captivity in a dark cutthroat disfunctional household home. They’re strapped to chairs, beaten every day and starved due mental illness from their parents. Their only view of the outside world is a small window in the basement. They endure abuse day by day and adapt to it as if it’s normal. One day, one sibling breaks free. He steps outside captivity from the home. It’s overwhelming at first the sunlight hurts, the people are different and the natural world feels unfamiliar. But slowly, the sibling begins to see reality for what it is, beautiful, and more amazing than anything the sibling experienced. The sibling realizes that the captivity was a filtered illusion, a comfortable lie.Filled with excitement and a sense of purpose, the sibling returns to the captivity home to rescue the siblings  and tell them the good news. But when the sibling speaks about the world beyond the captivity home no one believes the sibling. They mock the sibling and call the sibling delusional, and cling harder to the pain they’ve been use to. Some are even angry and say how dare the sibling question their reality? Until they experience themselves what the sibling experienced then they become truly happy joyous and free. 
11. How would you live differently if Nietzsche’s myth of eternal recurrence was shown to be true? Answer: If every pain and every joy were to repeat themselves over and over again was Deep, but I would tell that demon , “ I rebuke you in the mighty Name of Jesus Christ because the Word of God says “ Revelation 21:1: "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea." but if Nietzsche’s myth was true I would prepare for every painful incident to minimize it and prepare for every joyful incident to maximize it. Here is a link to watch on this:https://youtu.be/CY40og9z-p0?si=sKuhGSZNEZcoPTqHLinks to an external site.
12. Who do you think won the quantum debate between Einstein and Bohr? Be sure to back up your argument with key quotes from the readings or from your own research. I truly believe Einstein won because he said “ God does not play dice with the universe” in other words everything is perfectly made versus Bohr’s “We must accept that nature is strange”. But I believe God reveals himself through nature. 

12. Why was Bruno regarded as a heretic for his views? Answer : Because he challenged Christian and Catholic teachings. Creation of an infinite universe versus just earth as the center and pantheism where God is present in everything. I believe it too because imagine the power of the creator , I would place myself in everything , a person , a tree, a fish etc an alien life in another world and feel omnipresent universally , that’s my 11% brain power thinking. 

13. How can Darwin’s theory of natural selection explain the emergence of consciousness? Answer: Animals showed how small changes caused emergence of consciousness like thinking , learning , and feeling emotions which helped them better survive and adapt to their environments much better. 

14. Why did Darwin and Wallace part company over the human mind? Answer: They were in disagreement on how it developed. I’m on Einstein’s side he’s my favorite philosopher. 
15. So far, what is your favorite film? Answer: I would have to say “ The Death of Socrates” because it was my first film that opened my eyes to philosophy, it was interesting. 
16 LIST ALL OF YOUR POSTS AND PASTE THEM WITH THE TEST : Introduce yourself and your interest : Hello Everyone. My name is Julio Mendez and I’m working on my AS in Realestate. I love the beach and watching movies. I enjoyed watching the first couple of videos available on Philosophy, they were intriguing. I’m looking forward to learning everything about Philosophy. Reply post to peer : Hello Roberto. Cool that you enjoy traveling, the feeling is mutual. Also, cool that you like visiting museums and gardens. I recommend the Science Center next to the LA Coliseum it’s amazing and the movies in their theatre are awesome. There is also a Rose Garden in the vicinity that’s pretty cool. Good luck. 
Week 1 Assignment: Julio Mendez 
Professor Lane 
Philosophy 1 
April 21, 2025

In The Apology, Socrates argues that "the unexamined life is not worth living." Explain the significance of this statement and discuss its implications for individual and societal growth.

In The Apology Socrates Declaration: “The Unexamined Life Is Not Worth Living”

 Socrates asserts, “The unexamined life is not worth living,” a profound statement that captures his dedication to self inquiry. This statement made during his trial declares the essential role in achieving a meaningful existence and highlights its broader implications for individual  advancement. Socrates believed that true wisdom stems from recognizing one’s ignorance and continuously questioning one’s beliefs and actions. Individuals risk leading lives without purpose merely conforming to norms in society without understanding their own values or the reasons behind their choices. This lack of self awareness can lead to a superficial existence where actions are dictated by external influences rather than internal convictions.

The theme “the unexamined life is not worth living for” resonates throughout Socrates teachings and defense. He dedicates himself to examining himself and others provoking critical thought and challenging societal assumptions. Socrates viewed the pursuit of knowledge and virtue as the highest human calling. He argued that acknowledging one’s ignorance is the first step toward wisdom. By critically assessing our lives, we can align our actions with our values, leading to personal growth and ethical living. Without such examination, individuals risk drifting through life, guided by unchallenged assumptions and societal norms, rather than conscious, reasoned choices.

In a level within society Socratic examination fosters supports a culture of critical thinking. When people question and engage in thoughtful discourse, societies become more just. Socrates himself supported this through his method of questioning and encouraging others to scrutinize their beliefs and the status quo.

In a time characterized by rapid technological advancements and information overload, taking the time to reflect on one’s life, choices, and beliefs is more crucial than ever. It serves as a reminder that a life of continuous learning is fundamental to personal integrity and well being in society. 

Although Pythagoras and Socrates did not live during the same period. Pythagoras was born before Socrates around 25 years before Pythagoras’s philosophical and mathematical ideas, particularly those related to mathematics and metaphysics, significantly influenced Socrates and Plato. 

To what extent is Socrates a model citizen? Consider his commitment to truth, his obedience to the law, and his willingness to sacrifice his life for his beliefs.

Socrates as a Model Citizen: A Personal Reflection on Integrity and Faith. 

Socrates unwavering commitment to truth, obedience to the law, and his ultimate sacrifice for his beliefs have long been subjects of philosophical admiration and debate. His life suggests to consider the essence of citizenship and personal integrity.

Socrates exemplified the virtues of a model citizen through his relentless pursuit of truth and moral integrity. He challenged society encouraging critical thought and self examination among his fellow Athenians. His respect for the law was evident when he chose to accept his death sentence rather than escape, believing that evading the law would harm the city’s moral fabric . This act demonstrated his belief in the social contract and the importance of upholding justice, even at personal cost. 

Some argue that Socrates strict adherence to the law, despite its flaws, may have limited his capacity to enact change. By accepting an unjust verdict, he missed an opportunity to challenge and reform the legal system from within. Additionally, his method of questioning, while intellectually stimulating, often alienated those in power, potentially hindering constructive dialogue.

My journey toward understanding integrity was profoundly influenced by my personal encounter with Jesus Christ. This experience instilled in me a commitment to live authentically, guided by faith and moral conviction. Like Socrates, I believe in the importance of self examination and standing firm in one’s beliefs. My faith teaches me the value of grace and the possibility of redemption. Socrates chose death to uphold his principles to inspire change with integrity through action and compassion. I really respect that. 

In conclusion, Socrates serves as a compelling model of civic virtue and personal integrity. His life challenges us to reflect on our values and the lengths we are willing to go to uphold them. His commitment to truth even in the face of death shows the profound impact of living a life guided by principle and moral courage. I respect Socrates to the fullest. 

Philosophy Discussion Forum Week 3 :

Analyze the philosophical underpinnings of the Einstein-Bohr debate. How did their differing worldviews shape their interpretations of quantum mechanics?

The Einstein-Bohr debate remains one of the most philosophical confrontations in modern science. There is visions of reality and the nature of knowledge. Albert Einstein believed the universe operated according to discoverable laws. He rejected quantum mechanics declaring that “God does not play dice with the universe.” For Einstein, the  interpretation of quantum events pointed to an incomplete theory that lacked hidden variables to explain underlying causes. I personally align with Einstein’s view that there is no coincidence or a mere probability in a universe so perfectly made. I believe God’s thinking is infinitely higher than ours and what appears to be random to us is part of a deeper divine design because God works in mysterious ways. Einstein’s deep thinking, though rooted in science, often reflected a profound reverence for the divine. He once said, “My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive.” His awe for the cosmos was not detached from his belief in a Creator but rather, it strengthened it. He viewed his intellect as a gift from God and often expressed gratitude through his pursuit of truth, seeing science as a way to honor the One who made him.This is why Einstein is my favorite philosopher and Socrates is my second favorite philosopher now. 
On the other hand Niels Bohr argued that quantum mechanics does not describe objective reality itself but only the outcomes of measurements. Niels Bohr believed that Copenhagens interpretation proposed that properties like position or momentum do not have definite values until observed and that the observer plays an integral role in shaping physical reality. This difference of Einstein’s realism versus Bohr’s instrumentalism transcended physics and entered the realm of metaphysics. It raised deep questions about what it means to “know” reality and whether the universe exists independently of observation. Though the debate remained unresolved during their lifetimes, its legacy continues to inform philosophical and scientific thought on the nature of reality in the quantum world. (339 count) 

Discuss the role of thought experiments in the development and interpretation of quantum theory. Provide specific examples and analyze their contributions.

Albert Einstein also utilized thought experiments to critique quantum theory. His “EPR paradox” (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) aimed to show that quantum mechanics was incomplete by demonstrating “spooky action at a distance” where particles seem to affect each other instantly across vast space. Einstein’s thought experiment supported his belief in determinism and hidden variables, contrasting sharply with the probabilistic nature of the Copenhagen interpretation. The pros of thought experiments include the ability to clarify complex concepts, expose logical flaws, and provoke philosophical inquiry. They allow scientists to engage with abstract ideas in creative ways. However, cons include the risk of oversimplification and the fact that they rely heavily on interpretation rather than empirical evidence. Thought experiments like Schrödinger’s cat and the EPR paradox have not only shaped the framework of quantum theory but also deepened debates about reality, observation, and the limits of human understanding.
Einstein’s belief in a rational universe created by a higher intelligence deeply influenced his thinking. In developing the EPR paradox, he relied on his conviction that God would not design a universe governed by randomness. His spiritual belief in divine order gave him the courage to question dominant theories and seek deeper, unified truths behind quantum behavior. For Einstein, the language of science was a way of understanding the mind of God. (215 count) 

Week 4 Discussion Forum Philosophy 

Question : Analyze the role of both natural and sexual selection in shaping the traits of organisms. How do these processes interact and contribute to the diversity of life?

Natural selection plays a big role in shaping the diversity of life by helping animals survive longer in their environment. One pro is that it gives animals special traits that help them hunt and protect themselves and find food like owls with night vision. These traits improve their chances of survival. However, a con is that not all animals get these helpful traits, so some may struggle to survive and even go extinct if they can’t adapt fast enough. Animals without good defense or food finding abilities might die off. Natural selection brings both advantages and challenges to life. With evolution still happening, it’s interesting to wonder what new traits will appear in the future to help animals survive or which animals will die. 

Sexual selection focuses on traits that help animals attract mates to reproduce. A pro is that it helps animals pass on their genes and avoid extinction like male deer fighting to win a mate. But a con is that these traits can sometimes make the animal stand out to predators. Loud calls may attract attention but also put the animal in danger. Sexual selection helps keep life going but can sometimes make survival harder.


Discuss the importance of variability and inheritance in Darwin’s theory of evolution. How do these concepts relate to the formation of new species and the adaptation of organisms to their environments?

In Darwin’s theory of evolution, inheritance means passing down helpful traits from parent to offspring. A pro is that these traits help the next generation survive a much better life. Elephants are born with long trunks to eat, drink, and breathe more easily. Elephants adapt to their environment but a con is that sometimes harmful traits can also be passed down which can cause health problems or make survival harder way much harder. If bad traits continue it can bring risks but inheritance can improve a species. 

Variability and differences between members of the same species also is very important because a pro is that it gives some animals special advantages in certain environments helping them survive to avoid predators. Evolution  keeps moving forward and allows natural selection to work. However, a con is that not all changes are good some can make animals weaker or less fit for survival. Darwin also believed that changes in life conditions could increase variability creating even more differences. Without variability, natural selection wouldn’t work because there would be nothing new to select. We see animals changing over time like how some elephants growing tusks while others don’t. Variability helps life adapt. 


17. What is quantum superposition? 

Answer : Quantum Superposition shows that something can be in two or more states at once, something that feels impossible in our normal life. 
This helps us understand how God being all powerful (omnipotent) makes sense. If tiny parts of God’s creation can do something strange like be in two states at once, it shows that God’s power goes way beyond human logic.
It’s like God already designed the universe with laws that show His greatness with things we can’t fully understand but are very real. Quantum Superposition shows us that God’s power is not limited to what we see or think makes sense. He holds all things together, even the impossible.

Jeremiah 32:17 
“Ah, Sovereign Lord, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you.”

Isaiah 55:8-9 
“For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” declares the Lord. “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.”


17. Analyze the following film from a philosophical perspective, explaining what it implies about human beings and their behavior.https://youtu.be/G-K8Usdy71k?si=3sxWv9EQxnCnuRV0Links to an external site.

Answer: The Three  Hermets : For your Father knows what things ye in need of before ye would ask him. The Gospel of Mathew versus 7&8. 

17. Any questions?

Extra Credit : I Read “ A Scientific Notebook” My favorite is “ Anyone who is practically acquainted with scientific work is aware that those who refuse to go beyond fact, rarely get as far as fact; and anyone who has studied the history of science knows that almost every great step therein has been made by the "anticipation of Nature." 

Question : Does God reveal himself through Nature ?
